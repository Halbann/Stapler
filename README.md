Stapler is a mod for KSP that adds a construction mode to the editor that lets you re-parent parts without changing their position.

You use re-parent mode just like you would use the re-root function in stock, it even has its icon in the same place. The keybind to enter re-parenting quickly is 5 (6 if you have TweakScale Rescaled installed, which also adds a construction mode).

This is a minimal remake of Spartwo's Stapler mod, with none of the other planned features. They may be merged at some point in the future.
